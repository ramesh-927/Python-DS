Docstring for FacebookInterview.LeetCodeSolutions.01-ArrayAndStrings.05-26.RemoveDuplicatesfromSortedArray

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each 
unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
Consider the number of unique elements in nums to be k​​​​​​​​​​​​​​. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements k.
The first k elements of nums should contain the unique numbers in sorted order. The remaining elements beyond index k - 1 
can be ignored.
Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length
int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation
assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

# unique element and another (k) iterating through the array. Whenever a new unique value is 
# found, I increment left and copy the value there, ensuring in-place removal in O(n) time and O(1)
