Docstring for FacebookInterview.LeetCodeSolutions.01-ArrayAndStrings.02-8.StringtoInteger(atoi)

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.
The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:
1. Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
2. Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity 
if neither present.
3. Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered 
or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
4. Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the 
integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and 
integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.

Example 1:
Input: s = "42"
Output: 42
Explanation:
The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^
Example 2:
Input: s = " -042"
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
               ^
Example 3:
Input: s = "1337c0d3"
Output: 1337
Explanation:
Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
Example 4:
Input: s = "0-1"
Output: 0
Explanation:
Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
          ^
Example 5:
Input: s = "words and 987"
Output: 0
Explanation:
Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.

Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 200
s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.

# Time Complexity : O(n), where n is string length, because the string is scanned once.
# Space Complexity : O(1), only a few variables, no extra arrays/strings.

# Exactly matches the rules: ignores leading spaces, handles optional sign, stops at first non‑digit, 
# clamps to 32‑bit bounds, returns 0 if no digits.

# “I used a single pass parsing algorithm: skip spaces, read optional sign, then accumulate digits into 
# an integer while checking for 32‑bit overflow before each step.”
