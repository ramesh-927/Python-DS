# Interview question: Top IPs from a log file
"""
Write a Python script to extract all IP addresses from a log file.
Count the occurrences of each IP and print the top 5 most frequent.
Make sure it works efficiently for large files.
Regex-focused
Given a line from a log, write a regex to extract the IP address.
How would you modify it to ignore ports?
