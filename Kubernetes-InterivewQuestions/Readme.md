Q1 : Your application experiences varying levels of traffic throughout the day. How would you implement autoscaling to handle increased demand automatically?

A:- To handle variable workloads efficiently, I’d design a multi-layer autoscaling solution in Kubernetes that responds dynamically to traffic while maintaining reliability, performance, and cost control.

First, I’d make sure the application architecture supports horizontal scaling —meaning services are stateless, session data is externalized (for example, to Redis or DynamoDB), and readiness/liveness probes are properly configured. This ensures Pods can scale up or down safely without impacting user experience.

Second, I’d configure a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) on each microservice deployment.
The HPA would monitor key metrics — typically CPU utilization or custom metrics like requests per second or queue length via Prometheus Adapter. For instance, I’d target 60–70% utilization with limits such as minReplicas: 2 and maxReplicas: 30.
When load increases, Kubernetes automatically spins up more Pods; when it drops, it scales back — all without downtime.

Third, to ensure adequate underlying capacity, I’d enable the Cluster Autoscaler on the cloud platform (EKS, GKE, or AKS). This ensures that when new Pods can’t be scheduled due to resource constraints, the cluster automatically provisions additional nodes — and removes them when utilization drops — optimizing both performance and cost.

Fourth, I’d fine-tune scaling behavior to prevent oscillation. Using HPA’s behavior settings, stabilization windows, and PodDisruptionBudgets, I can ensure controlled, gradual scaling that avoids thrashing during short traffic spikes.
For event-driven workloads, like asynchronous jobs or message queues, I’d integrate KEDA to scale based on external triggers (e.g., Kafka lag or message count), even allowing scale-to-zero for cost efficiency.
Finally, I’d add observability — integrating Prometheus, Grafana, and alerting — to visualize scaling patterns and verify responsiveness under load tests.
If predictable traffic patterns exist, I might complement this with predictive or scheduled autoscaling to pre-warm capacity ahead of known peaks.
In summary: my autoscaling design combines HPA (Pod level), Cluster Autoscaler (node level), and custom or event-driven metrics (via Prometheus/KEDA) — resulting in a resilient, self-healing, and cost-optimized system that scales seamlessly with real-world demand.

Highlights to emphasize in delivery:
“Multi-layer autoscaling: HPA + Cluster Autoscaler + KEDA”
“Stateless, probe-driven, and observable design”
“Behavior tuning to prevent thrashing”
“Predictive or event-driven scaling for efficiency”
