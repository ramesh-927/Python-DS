Docstring for AppleInterview.08-Others.57-36.ValidSudoku
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to 
the following rules:
Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:
A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
Example 1:
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. 
Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

Constraints:
board.length == 9
board[i].length == 9
board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.

# Time Complexity:  Overall: O(1) time (fixed size), but for a general N x N grid, it's O(N²).
# Space Compleixty: O(n²) — sets store at most all filled cells

# I used three lists of hash sets: one for tracking unique numbers in each row, one for columns, and 
# one for 3x3 boxes. We iterate through the 9x9 board once; for each filled cell, compute its box index,
#  check for duplicates in the corresponding sets, and add the number if unique—return false on any 
# duplicate, else true.
