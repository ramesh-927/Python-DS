Docstring for AppleInterview.001-AppleSpring23HighFrequency.21-36.ValidSudoku
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the 
following rules:
1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:
1. A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
2. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
Example 1:
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since 
there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
Constraints:
board.length == 9
board[i].length == 9
board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.

    # I used hash sets to track unique numbers in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid while iterating 
    # through the board in a single pass. This ensures O(1) time complexity for the fixed 9x9 grid 
    # by checking for duplicates instantly without redundant work.

    # This approach is the best for this problem because it uses "hash sets" (fancy buckets that check 
    # for duplicates instantly), making it efficient and simple.
