"""
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each 
number sorted in non-decreasing order.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
Example 2:
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) 
solution using a different approach?

# "Since the array is sorted, the largest squares must be at one of the two ends — either the most 
# negative or most positive number.
# So I use two pointers starting from both ends, compare absolute values, and fill the result from 
# right to left in O(n) time."

# Time Complexity : O(n) → Best possible
# Space Complexity: O(n) → Required for output
