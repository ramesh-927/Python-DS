# Python-DS — SRE & Python Projects by Ramesh Babu Golla

I build Python tools and exercises focused on SRE, automation, observability, and log parsing.  
Key highlights:
- **SRE-Practices/** — scripts & notebooks for monitoring, alert simulation, and runbooks (Python, Docker).
- **Log-parsingIntervie-SRE/** — production-style log parsing and anomaly detection examples.
- **AppleInterview/** — targeted problems and solutions relevant to large-scale systems.

Quick start:
1. See `SRE-Practices/README.md` for runnable examples (Docker + scripts).
2. Run a sample: `cd SRE-Practices/simple-monitor && docker-compose up` (or run `python monitor.py`).

Contact & resume:  
- GitHub: https://github.com/ramesh-927/Python-DS  
- Email: rgolla927@gmail.com — open to discuss how these map to SRE roles.
