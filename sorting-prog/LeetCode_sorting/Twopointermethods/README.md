The two-pointer technique is a very common approach used in array and string problems where you maintain two indices and move them toward each other (or in the same direction) based on some condition. It is especially powerful when dealing with sorted arrays, palindromes, or partitioning problems.
How Two Pointer Technique Works:
* Start-Pointer & End-Pointer: One starts at the beginning and the other at the end.
* Left-Pointer & Right-Pointer: Both pointers move based on a condition (e.g., sum, match, etc.).
* Same Direction Pointers: Used in slow/fast pointer patterns (e.g., detecting cycles in linked lists).
