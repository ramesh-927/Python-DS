As a 15+ years experienced **DevOps/SRE engineer** specializing in **automating scalable, secure, and highly available infrastructure (on-prem and cloud)**, interviewers will target **real-world architecture, automation, operational reliability**, and **team leadership** questions. Here's what you can expect, categorized and aligned with your expertise:

---

 🔧 **Infrastructure Automation & IaC**

**Expect questions like:**

* How do you ensure *idempotency* in infrastructure automation using Terraform or Ansible?
* Can you walk us through a Terraform module you’ve created for multi-region deployment?
* How do you manage secrets and environment-specific configurations across multiple environments?
* How do you handle drift detection and state management in IaC?

✅ *Be prepared to talk about tools:* Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi, Crossplane.

---

☁️ **Cloud & On-Prem Hybrid Architecture**

**Expect questions like:**

* Describe a hybrid cloud architecture you’ve implemented. What were the key challenges?
* How do you architect for HA (High Availability) across on-prem and cloud?
* How do you decide between using AWS-native services vs self-managed open-source tools?

✅ *Expect tool discussions around:* AWS (VPC, Transit Gateway, Direct Connect), GCP, EKS/ECS, VPNs, etc.

---

🔄 **CI/CD & Automation Pipelines**

**Expect questions like:**

* How do you design a secure and scalable CI/CD pipeline for microservices?
* Describe a pipeline you’ve automated from code commit to deployment.
* What tools have you used (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Harness, ArgoCD)? Why?
* How do you handle rollback strategies during a failed deployment?

✅ Include *blue/green, canary*, and *feature toggle* experiences.

---

🧠 **SRE, Observability, and Reliability**

**Expect questions like:**

* How do you define and track **SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets**?
* How do you identify and remove **single points of failure**?
* Describe a production incident you resolved. What was your root cause analysis process?
* What observability tools have you used (Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog, Dynatrace)?

✅ They want to see *how you think under pressure* and *drive postmortems.*



🔐 **Security and Compliance**

**Expect questions like:**

* How do you integrate security controls in your automation workflows?
* How do you handle patching and vulnerability management at scale?
* What’s your approach to IAM, network segmentation, and least-privilege principles?

✅ Bonus if you’ve worked with tools like *Vault, AWS KMS, or Open Policy Agent (OPA)*.

---

🧩 **System Design & Scalability

*Expect questions like:**

* Design a scalable infrastructure to support a global application with 99.99% uptime.
* How do you scale Kubernetes clusters across regions?
* How do you ensure your system can handle burst traffic or large-scale events?

✅ Talk about *auto-scaling, load balancing, service mesh (Istio, Linkerd), horizontal pod autoscaling.*



👥 **Leadership, Mentoring, and Collaboration

**Expect questions like:

* How do you mentor junior engineers and onboard new team members?
* How do you manage conflicts between Dev and Ops teams regarding release timelines?
* How do you prioritize reliability work alongside feature delivery?

✅ They’re evaluating *communication, empathy, and stakeholder management.*



🛠️ **Tool-Specific Deep Dives

You might also get specific prompts like:

* "Explain the lifecycle of a Helm chart in your Kubernetes workflow."
* "How would you use Kustomize to deploy the same app to multiple environments?"
* "How did you integrate policy-as-code (e.g., with Sentinel or OPA) into your Terraform deployments?"



 🔄 Sample Scenario-Based Questions

1. **“You need to migrate a monolith to microservices—how would you approach infrastructure, networking, and observability?”**
2. **“Production deployment failed—how do you triage and recover with minimal downtime?”**
3. **“You need to audit all production services for compliance—what’s your plan?”**
